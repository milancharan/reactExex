<h1>ReactIntermediate</h1><p>We have a family tree which is in <strong>FamilyTree JSON</strong>. If the parent has children, it will be inside an array called Children.</p><p>If that Child has Children, it will inside their Children Array. there can be a possibility of "n" level of nesting in the family tree.</p><p>Render the family tree as child should be under the parents shown below.</p><p><img src="https://apitutorial.dev.radixweb.net:443/public/uploads/files1683284991005-MicrosoftTeams-image (20).png"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- There should be component called person that will print name of the person and reuse the person component to display children.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>FamilyTree JSON as per the following:</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>const familyTree = {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "John",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 90,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;"children": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Mary",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 60<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Arthur",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 60,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"children": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Lily",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 35,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"children": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Hank",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 60<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Henry",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 57<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Billy",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 37<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Dolores",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 55<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Bob",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 60,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"children": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Jack",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 35,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"children": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Rose",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 60<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Sam",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 57,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"children": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"name": "Tom",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"age": 37<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;]<br>}</p>
